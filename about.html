      <p>
        This project is a curated collection of scientific articles focused on
        neurodiversity, neurodevelopmental conditions, their clinical,
        functional and societal implications.
      </p>

      <p>
        The archive was created to organize peer-reviewed research across
        themes such as autism spectrum conditions, ADHD, migraine, and
        neurodevelopmental comorbidities, with the goal of facilitating
        interdisciplinary understanding and evidence-based discussion.
