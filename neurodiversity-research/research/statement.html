      <h3>Statement of Research Philosophy</h3>

      <p>
        My research philosophy is grounded in the understanding that neurodiversity
        represents a complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic dimension of human variation,
        rather than a set of isolated deficits or categorical pathologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I approach scientific research with the conviction that meaningful knowledge in
        neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions emerges from the careful integration
        of data, context, and ethical responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        I view knowledge as provisional and cumulative. Scientific evidence is continuously
        refined as new data, methods, and perspectives become available. For this reason,
        I prioritize transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor, while remaining
        attentive to the limitations inherent in observational data, clinical samples, and
        statistical modeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Methodologically, my work integrates quantitative analysis, statistical reasoning,
        and bioinformatics with domain knowledge from neuroscience and mental health research.
        Data analysis is treated as a tool for understanding biological and functional
        patterns, not as an instrument for oversimplification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exploratory analyses, when conducted responsibly, are essential for generating
        hypotheses, revealing latent structures, and identifying meaningful associations
        that may not be apparent through purely confirmatory approaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ethically, my research is guided by a commitment to non-reductionism and respect for
        individual variability. In the context of neurodiversity, I am particularly cautious
        about interpretations that frame neurological differences solely in terms of impairment,
        ignoring adaptive traits, environmental interactions, and lived experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        I emphasize critical evaluation and curation of scientific literature, with attention
        to study design, sample characteristics, and analytical decisions. By organizing and
        synthesizing research across domains such as autism, ADHD, migraine, and psychiatric
        comorbidities, my aim is to contribute to a more integrated and nuanced understanding
        of neurodevelopmental conditions and their real-world impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, I view research as both a technical and ethical endeavor. Sound analysis,
        clear methodology, and responsible interpretation are inseparable. My goal is to
        contribute to scientific knowledge that is robust, transparent, and respectful of
        human diversity.
