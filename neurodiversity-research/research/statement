Statement of Research Philosophy

My research philosophy is grounded in the understanding that neurodiversity represents a complex, heterogeneous and dynamic dimension of human variation, rather than a set 
of isolated deficits or categorical pathologies. 
I approach scientific research with the conviction that meaningful knowledge in neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions emerges from the careful integration of data, 
context, and ethical responsibility.

I view knowledge as provisional and cumulative. Scientific evidence is not static, but continuously refined as new data, methods, and perspectives become available. For this 
reason, I prioritize transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor, while remaining attentive to the limitations inherent in observational data, clinical samples and 
statistical modeling—especially when working with underrepresented or vulnerable populations.

Methodologically, my work values the integration of quantitative analysis, statistical reasoning and bioinformatics with domain knowledge from neuroscience and mental health 
research. I believe that data analysis should serve as a tool for understanding biological and functional patterns, not as an instrument for oversimplification. Exploratory 
analyses, when conducted responsibly, are essential for generating hypotheses, revealing hidden structures and identifying meaningful associations that may not be apparent through 
purely confirmatory approaches.

Ethically, my research is guided by a commitment to non-reductionism and respect for individual variability. In the context of neurodiversity, I am particularly cautious about 
interpretations that frame neurological differences solely in terms of impairment, ignoring adaptive traits, environmental interactions, and lived experience. I consider it essential 
to distinguish statistical associations from causal claims and to communicate findings in a way that minimizes stigma and misinterpretation.

My work emphasizes the critical evaluation and curation of scientific literature, with attention to study design, sample characteristics, and analytical choices. By organizing and 
synthesizing research across domains such as autism, ADHD, migraine and psychiatric comorbidities, I aim to contribute to a more integrated and nuanced understanding of neurodevelopmental 
conditions and their real world impact.

Ultimately, I see research as both a technical and ethical endeavor. Sound analysis, clear methodology and responsible interpretation are inseparable. My goal is to contribute to 
scientific knowledge that is robust, transparent and respectful of human diversity, supporting evidence-based dialogue between data science, neuroscience and public health.
