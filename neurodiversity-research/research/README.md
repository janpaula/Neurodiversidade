# Neurodiversity Research — In Progress

## Overview

This directory contains **ongoing research analyses** related to neurodiversity, with a focus on autism spectrum conditions, ADHD, migraine, and their comorbidities.  
The materials presented here represent **work in progress**, including exploratory data analyses, literature synthesis, methodological notes, and preliminary interpretations.

Content in this folder **has not yet been consolidated** into the public-facing scientific portfolio and should be considered **pre-publication and iterative**.

---

## Research Scope

Current areas of investigation include, but are not limited to:

- Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC)
- Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Migraine and headache disorders
- Neurodevelopmental and neurological comorbidities
- Sensory processing and pain perception
- Functional and quality-of-life impacts
- Genetic, neurobiological, and statistical correlations

---

## Structure

Analyses are organized by thematic domain:

research/
├── autism/
├── migraine/
├── adhd/
└── comorbidities/


Each folder may include:
- Data exploration notebooks
- Statistical analyses
- Literature summaries
- Methodological notes
- Figures and tables (exploratory)
- Intermediate conclusions subject to revision

## Methodological Approach

The research process typically follows these stages:

1. **Literature identification and curation**
2. **Data extraction and preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
4. **Statistical modeling and visualization**
5. **Interpretative synthesis**
6. **Critical review and validation**

Only analyses that reach methodological consistency and interpretative maturity are migrated to the **Scientific Portfolio** section of the project.

## Scientific Integrity

To preserve transparency and rigor:

- All interpretations are grounded in peer-reviewed literature
- Limitations and uncertainties are explicitly documented
- Analyses may be revised as new evidence emerges
- No content in this directory should be cited as final conclusions

---

## Relationship to the Public Scientific Portfolio

Once an analysis is:
- Methodologically complete
- Scientifically coherent
- Properly contextualized

It may be **refined, translated, and published** in the main scientific section of the Neurodiversity portfolio.

This separation ensures a clear distinction between:
- **Research-in-progress**
- **Curated and validated scientific content**
